  abstract = {Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end
              security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to
              the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in
              delivering messages. Establishing keys to provide such protections
              is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two
              clients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same
              time. In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol
              that provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with
              forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) for groups
              in size ranging from two to thousands.},

  abstract = {We prove a computational soundness theorem for symmetric-key
              encryption protocols that can be used to analyze security against
              adaptively corrupting adversaries (that is, adversaries who corrupt
              protocol participants during protocol execution). Our soundness
              theorem shows that if the encryption scheme used in the protocol is
              semantically secure, and encryption cycles are absent , then
              security against adaptive corruptions is achievable via a reduction
              factor of O(n undefined (2n)l), with n and l being (respectively)
              the size and depth of the key graph generated during any protocol
              execution. Since, in most protocols of practical interest, the
              depth of key graphs (measured as the longest chain of ciphertexts
              of the form undefinedk1 (k2), undefinedk2 (k3), undefinedk3 (k4),
              ...) is much smaller than their size (the total number of keys),
              this gives us a powerful tool to argue about the adaptive security
              of such protocols, without resorting to non-standard techniques
              (like non-committing encryption). We apply our soundness theorem to
              the security analysis of multicast encryption protocols and show
              that a variant of the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol is
              adaptively secure (its security being quasi-polynomially related to
              the security of the underlying encryption scheme).},

              access to a public random oracle—provides a bridge between
              cryptographic theory and cryptographic practice. In the paradigm we
              suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and
              proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then
              replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an “appropriately
              chosen” function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more
              efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages
              of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems
              including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},
