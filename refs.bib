  abstract = {Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end
              security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to
              the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in
              delivering messages. Establishing keys to provide such protections
              is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two
              clients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same
              time. In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol
              that provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with
              forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) for groups
              in size ranging from two to thousands.},

              authenticity and privacy, but they also guarantee forward secrecy
              (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). The former ensures that
              messages sent and received before a state compromise remain secure,

              compromise as a consequence of normal protocol usage.",

              for end-to-end (E2E) secure group messaging being developed by the
              IETF, poised for deployment to consumers, industry, and government.
              It is designed to provide E2E privacy and authenticity for messages
              in long-lived sessions whenever possible, despite the participation
              (at times) of malicious insiders that can adaptively interact with
              the PKI at will, actively deviate from the protocol, leak honest
              parties’ states, and fully control the network. The core of the MLS
              protocol (from which it inherits essentially all of its efficiency
              and security properties) is a Continuous Group Key Agreement (CGKA)
              protocol. It provides asynchronous E2E group management by allowing
              group members to agree on a fresh independent symmetric key after
              every change to the group’s state (e.g. when someone joins/leaves
              the group).In this work, we make progress towards a precise
              understanding of the insider security of MLS (Draft 12). On the
              theory side, we overcome several subtleties to formulate the first
              notion of insider security for CGKA (or group messaging). Next, we
              isolate the core components of MLS to obtain a CGKA protocol we dub
              Insider Secure TreeKEM (ITK). Finally, we give a rigorous security
              proof for ITK. In particular, this work also initiates the study of
              insider secure CGKA and group messaging protocols. Along the way we
              give three new (very practical) attacks on MLS and corresponding
              fixes. (Those fixes have now been included into the standard.) We
              also describe a second attack against MLS-like CGKA protocols
              proven secure under all previously considered security notions
              (including those designed specifically to analyze MLS). These
              attacks highlight the pitfalls in simplifying security notions even
              in the name of tractability.},

  abstract = {The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) project is an IETF effort
              aiming to establish an industry-wide standard for secure group
              messaging (SGM). Its development is supported by several major
              secure-messaging providers (with a combined user base in the
              billions) and a growing body of academic research. MLS has evolved
              over many iterations to become a complex, non-trivial, yet
              relatively ad-hoc cryptographic protocol. In an effort to tame its
              complexity and build confidence in its security, past analyses of
              MLS have restricted themselves to sub-protocols of MLS---most
              prominently a type of sub-protocol embodying so-called continuous
              group key agreement (CGKA). However, to date the task of proving or
              even defining the security of the full MLS protocol has been left
              open. In this work, we fill in this missing piece. First, we
              formally capture the security of SGM protocols by defining a
              corresponding security game, which is parametrized by a safety
              predicate that characterizes the exact level of security achieved
              by a construction. Then, we cast MLS as an SGM protocol, showing
              how to modularly build it from the following three main components
              (and some additional standard cryptographic primitives) in a
              black-box fashion: (a) CGKA, (b) forward-secure group AEAD
              (FS-GAEAD), which is a new primitive and roughly corresponds to an
              "epoch'' of group messaging, and (c) a so-called PRF-PRNG, which is
              a two-input hash function that is a pseudorandom function (resp.
              generator with input) in its first (resp. second) input. Crucially,
              the security predicate for the SGM security of MLS can be expressed
              purely as a function of the security predicates of the underlying
              primitives, which allows to swap out any of the components and
              immediately obtain a security statement for the resulting SGM
              construction. Furthermore, we provide instantiations of all
              component primitives, in particular of CGKA with MLS's TreeKEM
              sub-protocol (which we prove adaptively secure) and of FS-GAEAD
              with a novel construction (which has already been adopted by MLS).
              Along the way we introduce a collection of new techniques,
              primitives, and results with applications to other SGM protocols
              and beyond. For example, we extend the Generalized Selective
              Decryption proof technique (which is central in CGKA literature)
              and prove adaptive security for another (practical) more secure
              CGKA protocol called RTreeKEM (Alwen et al., CRYPTO '20). The
              modularity of our approach immediately yields a corollary
              characterizing the security of an SGM construction using RTreeKEM.},

  abstract = {We prove a computational soundness theorem for symmetric-key
              encryption protocols that can be used to analyze security against
              adaptively corrupting adversaries (that is, adversaries who corrupt
              protocol participants during protocol execution). Our soundness
              theorem shows that if the encryption scheme used in the protocol is
              semantically secure, and encryption cycles are absent , then
              security against adaptive corruptions is achievable via a reduction
              factor of O(n undefined (2n)l), with n and l being (respectively)
              the size and depth of the key graph generated during any protocol
              execution. Since, in most protocols of practical interest, the
              depth of key graphs (measured as the longest chain of ciphertexts
              of the form undefinedk1 (k2), undefinedk2 (k3), undefinedk3 (k4),
              ...) is much smaller than their size (the total number of keys),
              this gives us a powerful tool to argue about the adaptive security
              of such protocols, without resorting to non-standard techniques
              (like non-committing encryption). We apply our soundness theorem to
              the security analysis of multicast encryption protocols and show
              that a variant of the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol is
              adaptively secure (its security being quasi-polynomially related to
              the security of the underlying encryption scheme).},
