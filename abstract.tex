	The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, recently standardized in RFC 9420 \cite{rfc9420}, aims to
	provide efficient asynchronous group key establishment with strong security guarantees. TreeKEM
	is the construction underlying MLS and a variant of it was proven adaptively secure in the Ran-
	dom Oracle Model (ROM) with a polynomial loss in security in \cite{ttkem}. The proof makes use of
	the Generalized Selective Decryption (GSD) security game introduced in \cite{gsd}, adapted to the
	public-key setting. GSD security is closely related to the security of TreeKEM and the encryp-
	tion scheme used in TreeKEM was proven to be GSD secure in the ROM under the standard
	assumption of IND-CPA security, implying a proof of security for TreeKEM (a sketch of this
	proof was provided in \cite{ttkem} for the TreeKEM variant).
