The graphs constructed in the public-key GSD game and the tree structure behind the TreeKEM protocol clearly resemble each other. Let $\eta$ denote the security parameter and let $\Pi$ the public-key encryption scheme under consideration, where $\Pi.\gen(1^\eta)$ uses $\rho(\eta)$ bits of randomness. We make some small modifications to the public-key GSD game such that the operations performed in TreeKEM match the ones performed in the GSD game. Take the functions $\hgen, \hdep$ used in TreeKEM first modify the game as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the key pair of a node $v$ is generated by sampling a seed $s_v \in \{0, 1\}^{\rho(\eta)}$ and computing $(pk_v, sk_v) = \Pi.\gen(1^\eta, s)$
	\item encryption queries encrypt the seed of the target node instead of its secret key
\end{itemize}
Now the generation of key pairs and the encryptions computed in TreeKEM match what is done in this adapted GSD game. (Although the key pair of a leaf in TreeKEM need not be generated through such a seed, we assumed this to be equivalent to running $\Pi.\gen(1^\eta)$ in Definition~\ref{def:public-key-encryption}.) To model the fact that in TreeKEM a seed of a node may depend on the seed of another node through $\hdep$ (as in the new direct path computed in a commit), we introduce a new type of edge which we call a \emph{seed dependency}: if there is a seed dependency $(u, v)$, then $s_v = \hdep(s_u)$. We call our adaptation of GSD security \emph{Seeded GSD with Dependencies} (SD-GSD).

\begin{definition}[The SD-GSD game] \label{def:sd-gsd-game}
	Let $\eta$ denote the security parameter and let $\Pi = (\gen, \enc, \dec)$ a public-key encryption scheme, where $\gen(1^\eta)$ uses $\rho(\eta)$ bits of randomness and $\{0, 1\}^{\rho(\eta)}$ is a subset of the message space.
	Let $\fhgen = \{ \hgen^{(\eta)} \mid \eta \in \N\}, \fhdep = \{ \hdh^{(\eta)} \mid \eta \in \N\}$ families of functions with $\hgen^{(\eta)}, \hdep^{(\eta)} \colon \{0, 1\}^{\rho(\eta)} \to \{0, 1\}^{\rho(\eta)}$. We will write $\hgen \coloneqq \hgen^{(\eta)}, \hdep \coloneqq \hdep^{(\eta)}$ and $\rho \coloneqq \rho(\eta)$ if $\eta$ is clear from the context.
	Define the game $\game{(\Pi, \fhgen, \fhdep)}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv)$ for an adversary $\adv$:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item $\adv$ is given $1^\eta$.
		\item \label{def:sd-gsd-game-step-init} The adversary $\adv$ is given $1^\eta$, and outputs $n \in \N$ and a list of dependencies $D = \{(a_{i}, b_{i})\}_{i=1}^m \in [n]^2$. For each $v \in [n]$:
		      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
			      \item \begin{itemize}
				            \item \textbf{Case $v = b_i$ for some $i$ ($v$ is the target of some dependency):} set $s_v = \hdep(s_{a_i})$.
				            \item \textbf{Otherwise:} sample $s_v \from \{0, 1\}^\rho$.
			            \end{itemize}
			            We call $s_v$ the \emph{seed} of the node $v$ and a tuple $(a, b) \in D$ a \emph{seed dependency}.
			      \item Compute $(pk_v, sk_v) = \gen(1^\eta, \hgen(s_v))$.
		      \end{enumerate}
		      Set $\mathcal{C} = E = \varnothing$. We call the directed graph $([n], E)$ a \emph{GSD graph} of \emph{size} $n$.
		\item $\adv$ may adaptively do the following queries:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item $\mathrm{reveal}(v)$ for $v \in [n]$: $\adv$ is given $pk_v$.
			      \item $\mathrm{encrypt}(u, v)$ for $u, v \in [n], u \neq v, (u, v) \notin E$: $(u, v)$ is added to $E$ and $\adv$ is given $c \from \enc_{pk_u}(s_v)$.
			      \item $\mathrm{corrupt}(v)$ for $v \in [n], v \notin \mathcal{C}$: $\adv$ is given $s_v$ and $v$ is added to $\mathcal{C}$. We call such a node $v \in \mathcal{C}$ \emph{corrupted}. All nodes not reachable from any corrupted node in the graph $([n], E \cup D)$ are \emph{safe} (while all other nodes are \emph{unsafe}) and we call their seeds \emph{hidden} (even if an unsafe node happens to have the same seed).
		      \end{itemize}
		\item $\adv$ outputs a node $v \in [n]$. We call $v$ the \emph{challenge node}. A bit $b \from \{0, 1\}$ is sampled and $\adv$ is given
		      \[
			      r = \begin{cases}
				      \hdep(s_v) & b = 0 \\
				      s          & b = 1
			      \end{cases},
		      \]
		      where $s \from \{0, 1\}^\rho$. \todo{Make it clear that $r$ is not a seed of a node and thus also not a hidden seed.} $\adv$ may continue to do queries as before.
		\item \label{def:sd-gsd-game-step-output} $\adv$ outputs a bit $b'$. The output of the game is defined to be $1$ if $b' = b$, and $0$ otherwise.
	\end{enumerate}

	We require an adversary playing the above game to adhere to the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The challenge node always remains a sink \todo{Not necessary?}
		\item The challenge node is safe
		\item $\operatorname{reveal}$ is never queried on the challenge node \todo{Not necessary?}
		\item The graphs $(V, E)$ and $(V, D)$ always remain acyclic and without self-loops
		\item All paths in the graph $(V, D)$ are vertex disjoint \todo{This avoids multiple sources for single target.}
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[SD-GSD security]
	Let $\Pi, \fhgen$ and $\fhdep$ as in Definition~\ref{def:sd-gsd-game} above and let $t, \epsilon, N, \delta$ functions in $\eta$.
	The triple $(\Pi, \hgen, \hdep)$ is \emph{$(t, \epsilon, N, \delta)$-SD-GSD-secure} if for all $\eta$, for any adversary $\adv$ constructing a GSD graph of size at most $N(\eta)$ and indegree at most $\delta(\eta)$ and running time in $t(\eta)$ we have
	\begin{align*}
		\advantage{(\Pi, \fhgen, \fhdep)}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv) \coloneqq 2 \cdot \left(\pr{\game{(\Pi, \fhgen, \fhdep)}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv) = 1} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \le \epsilon(\eta).
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Since in this work we are interested in SD-GSD security for the case where $\hgen$ and $\hdep$ are modelled as random oracles and our focus is on the encryption scheme being used, we introduce the following definition for convenience.

\begin{definition}[SD-GSD security in the ROM]
	A public-key encryption scheme $\Pi$ is \emph{$(t, \epsilon, N, \delta)$-SD-GSD-secure in the ROM} if the triple $(\Pi, \fhgen, \fhdep)$ is $(t, \epsilon, N, \delta)$-SD-GSD-secure when $\hgen$ and $\hdep$ are modelled as random oracles. For security parameter $\eta$ and an adversary $\adv$, we write $\game{\Pi}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv)$ to denote the game where $\hgen$ and $\hdep$ are modelled as random oracles and $\advantage{\Pi}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv)$ for $\adv$'s advantage in this game.
\end{definition}

\section{Proving SD-GSD security for DHIES in the ROM}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:sdgsd-security}
	Let $\eta$ denote the security parameter.
	Let $\dhies$ the DHIES scheme instantiated with a group-generation algorithm $\mathcal{G}$ and a private-key encryption scheme $\Pi_s$.  If $\Pi_s$ is $(t, \eeav)$-EAV-secure, the DDH problem is $(t, \eddh)$-hard relative to $\mathcal{G}$ and the function $\hdh$ in $\dhies$ is modelled as a random oracle, then for any $\delta, N$ with $\delta \le N$, $\dhies$ is $(\tilde{t}, \tilde{\epsilon}, N, \delta)$-SD-GSD-secure in the ROM with\footnote{Note that in the following equality we have omitted writing the argument $\eta$ to the various functions and are implying that the equality holds for all $\eta$.}
	\[
		\tilde{\epsilon} = 2 \cdot \delta \cdot N \cdot \eeav + 2 \cdot N \cdot \eddh + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^{\eta - 1}} + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^{\rho - 1}},
	\]
	where $\ms$ is an upper bound on the number of queries made to either $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ and $\mdh$ is an upper bound on the number of queries made to $\hdh$, and with
	\[
		\tilde{t} = t \begin{aligned}[t]
			- & \mathcal{O}
			\begin{aligned}[t]
				\big(\rho \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} \cdot \ms & + (\gamma + \eta \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}}) \cdot \mdh \\ + & N \cdot ((\rho + \eta) \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} + \mdh \cdot t_{\mathrm{op}} + t_{\dhies.\gen})  \\ + & N^2 \cdot t_{\dhies.\enc}\big), \\
			\end{aligned}
		\end{aligned}
	\]
	where the various variables denote the following
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $t_{\mathrm{sample}}$: time to sample a uniform bit
		\item $t_{\dhies.\enc}$: time to encrypt $s \in \{0, 1\}^\rho$ with $\dhies$
		\item $t_{\dhies.\gen}$: runtime of $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta)$ (which is strictly greater than the runtime of $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta, r)$ for input randomness $r$)
		\item $t_{\mathrm{op}}$: time to perform the group operation in a group output by $\mathcal{G}(1^\eta)$
		\item $\gamma$: maximum length of any query to $\hdh$
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\todo{Do it more precisely?}
For ease of exposition, we will assume that $\mathcal{G}(1^\eta)$ is deterministic, as is the case in practice, and denote the output by $\ldots = \mathcal{G}(1^\eta)$ to emphasize this. We will therefore set the $pk \coloneqq h_1, sk \coloneqq x$ in $\dhies.\gen$, as $\mathbb{G}, q, g$ are implied by $\eta$. The results nevertheless hold also for the general case. \todo{verify claim}

\paragraph{Intuition}
Consider an arbitrary SD-GSD adversary $\adv$. For an execution of $\game{\dhies}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv)$ we say ``\emph{$\adv$ wins}" to denote the event $\game{\dhies}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv) = 1$.
As usual with random oracles we proceed by a case distinction on whether they were queried on some interesting value. Accordingly, let $Q_{x}$ denote the event that $\adv$ queries $H_{x}$ on a hidden seed for $x \in \{\mathrm{gen}, \mathrm{dep}\}$. Then we can write
\begin{align} \label{eq:theorem-sd-gsd-security-win-cases}
	\begin{split}
		\pr{\wins} & = \pr{\wins \land \qdep} + \pr{\wins \land \overline{\qdep} \,} \\
		& \le \pr{\wins \land \qdep} + \pr{\wins \mid \overline{\qdep} \,} \\
		& \stackrel{\mathclap{(\dagger)}}{=}  \pr{\wins \land \qdep} + \frac{1}{2}         \\
		& \le \pr{\qdep} + \frac{1}{2} \\
		& \le \pr{\qs} + \frac{1}{2},
	\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\qs \coloneqq \qgen \cup \qdep$ ($\mathrm{s}$ for \emph{seed}). Step $(\dagger)$ intuitively holds because without having queried $\hdep$ for any hidden seed, in particular the seed $s_v$ of the challenge node $v$, $\hdep(s_v)$ is a uniformly random value from $\adv$'s perspective. Therefore, it can do no better than guessing to distinguish $\hdep(s_v)$ from $s \from \{0, 1\}^\rho$.

\todo{Motivate why we introduce $\qs$. (Reason: If we try to bound $\qdep$ by itself, we must separately deal with the case where the adversary was able to trigger it at a node $v$ by triggering $\qgen$ at a parent node $p$ and subsequently decrypting a ciphertext. But our argument  To eliminate this, we want to look at the point in time where either of the two events was first triggered.)}

The heart of the proof is to bound $\pr{\qs}$. When the adversary first triggers $\qs$ by querying the seed of some safe node $w$, (with overwhelming probability $w$ will be the only node with this seed and) it can only have learned the seed through encryptions
$c_1 \from \dhies.\enc_{pk_{u_1}}(s_w), \ldots, c_d \from \dhies.\enc_{pk_{u_d}}(s_w)$
where $(u_1, w), \ldots, (u_d, w)$ are edges in the GSD graph (obtained through corresponding queries $\operatorname{encrypt}(u_1, w), \ldots, \operatorname{encrypt}(u_d, w)$). The only other potential source of information about $s_w$ would be a seed dependency $(p, w)$, but this tells $\adv$ nothing: Since $w$ is safe, $p$ would also be safe and $\hdep(s_p)$ cannot have been queried due to the assumption that $w$ was the first node to trigger $\qs$.
Without having queried $\hdep(s_p)$, by virtue of $\hdep$ being a random oracle $s_w$ has the same distribution as a seed without a dependency from $\adv$'s perspective (uniformly random). See Figure~\ref{fig:gsd-qs-triggered} for an illustration of node $w$ in the GSD graph.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{figures/gsd-qs-triggered}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Illustration of the GSD graph when $\qs$ is triggered at a node $w$. The dashed edge represents a seed dependencey $(p, w)$ and the remaining edges represent encryption queries $c_i \from \operatorname{encrypt}(u_i, w)$.}
	\label{fig:gsd-qs-triggered}
\end{figure}

The proof in \cite{ttkem} simply argued that this is not too likely if these encryptions were made with an IND-CPA secure scheme. In the context of the DHIES scheme we can say more about these encryptions and achieve a better reduction loss.
Let $(\mathbb{G}, q, g) = \mathcal{G}(1^\eta)$.
Let $x_i = \log_g(pk_{u_i})$. Each encryption $c_i$ is a tuple of the form $\langle g^{y_i}, \Pi_s.\enc_{k_i}(s_w) \rangle$ where $y_i \from [q], k_i = \hdh\left(g^{x_i \cdot y_i}\right)$. Now we can again do a case distinction on whether $\hdh$ was queried for (the encoding of) some group element $g^{x_j \cdot y_j}$ or not:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item \label{qs-triggered-case-1} If such a query was made, then $\adv$ solved the Diffie-Hellman challenge $(g^{x_j}, g^{y_j})$. (Remember that we assumed that $w$ is the first node for which $\qs$ is triggered and as before if $w$ is safe, then so are the nodes $u_i$. Thus the adversary has not learned the exponent $x_i$ through querying $\hgen(s_{u_i})$ for any $i$.)
	\item \label{qs-triggered-case-2} If no such query was made, then from $\adv$'s perspective all the $k_i$ are independent, uniformly random keys and it still was able to learn $s_w$ from the EAV secure encryptions $\Pi_s.\enc_{k_1}(s_w), \ldots, \Pi_s.\enc_{k_d}(s_w)$.
\end{enumerate}
We can bound the probability of either of these events occurring using hardness of the DDH problem relative to $\mathcal{G}$ and EAV security of $\Pi_s$, respectively.

To this end, we call a group element $h \in \mathbb{G}$ a \emph{hidden Diffie-Hellman key} if $h = pk_u^{y_{u, v}}$, where $(u, v)$ is an edge in the GSD graph, $u$ is safe and $y_{u, v}$ is the exponent chosen in the DHIES encryption of $s_v$ (i.e. $\adv$ was given a ciphertext of the form $\langle g^{y_{u, v}}, \ldots\rangle$ when it queried $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, v)$). Now analogously to above let $\qdh$ the event that $\adv$ queries $\hdh$ on a hidden Diffie-Hellman key, and let $\fdh$ the event that $\adv$ triggers $\qdh$ when $\qs$ has not (yet) been triggered. Then we can split the event $\qs$ into two cases as motivated above:
\begin{align*}
	\pr{\qs} & = \pr{\qs \land \fdh} + \pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}.
\end{align*}
We bound $\pr{\qs \land \fdh}$ and $\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh} \,}$ in Lemma~\ref{lemma:dh-reduction} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}, respectively. Overall this gives us a bound on the advantage of $\adv$ using \eqref{eq:theorem-sd-gsd-security-win-cases}. (To be precise, the event $\qs \land \fdh$ is a superset of case (\ref{qs-triggered-case-1}) above. However, the argument applied in Lemma~\ref{lemma:dh-reduction} gives the same bound for either event and this more general event has the advantage of being simpler.)

\begin{proof}[of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}]
	Let $\delta, N$ functions in $\eta$ (mapping to $\N$) with $\delta \le N$.
	Let $\eta$ arbitrary and let $\adv$ an arbitrary SD-GSD adversary constructing a GSD graph of size at most $N(\eta)$ and indegree at most $\delta(\eta)$, making at most $\ms(\eta)$ queries to $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ and at most $\mdh(\eta)$ queries to $\hdh$, each of length at most $\gamma(\eta)$, and running in time $\tilde{t}(\eta)$. We will use the events defined above.

	We first justify step $(\dagger)$ in \eqref{eq:theorem-sd-gsd-security-win-cases}. Note that by the rules imposed on the adversary in the SD-GSD game, the challenge node $v$ is safe and its seed $s_v$ thus indeed hidden. If $\qdep$ does not hold, then $\adv$ has not queried $\hdep$ for $s_v$ and, by virtue of $\hdep$ being a random oracle, $\hdep(s_v)$ is a uniformly distributed value in $\{0, 1\}^\rho$ from $\adv$'s perspective. The value $s$ follows the same distribution. Thus, $\adv$ behaves the same when given either $r = s$ or $r = \hdep(s_v)$ and
	\begin{align} \label{eq:theorem-sd-gsd-security-not-qdep-behavior}
		\begin{split}
			\pr{1 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, b = 1} & = \pr{1 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, r = s}          \\
			& = \pr{1 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, r = \hdep(s_v)} \\
			& = \pr{1 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, b = 0}.
		\end{split}
	\end{align}
	Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		\pr{\wins \mid \overline{\qdep} \,} & = \begin{aligned}[t]
			                                         & \pr{1 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, b = 1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}   \\
			                                         & + \pr{0 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, b = 0} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
		                                        \end{aligned}                                                                             \\

			                                                                                                                     & + \pr{0 \from \adv \mid \overline{\qdep}, b = 0} \cdot \frac{1}{2}
		                                                                                                                    \end{aligned} \\
		                                    & = \frac{1}{2}.
	\end{align*}

	By Lemma~\vref{lemma:dh-reduction} we have\footnote{Note that we are again omitting the argument $\eta$ from the functions on the right hand side ($N, \eddh$ and $\mdh$ in this case).}
	\[
		\pr{\qs \land \fdh} \le N \cdot \eddh + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^\eta}.

	and by Lemma~\vref{lemma:eav-reduction} we have
	\[
		\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,} \le \delta \cdot N \cdot \eeav + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^\rho},
	\]
	so we know that
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:theorem-sd-gsd-security-qs-bound}
		\pr{\qs} \le N \cdot \eddh + \delta \cdot N \cdot \eeav + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^\eta} + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^\rho} = \tilde{\epsilon}(\eta) / 2.
	\end{equation}
	Then
	\begin{align*}
		\advantage{\Pi}{\eta}{SD-GSD}(\adv) & = 2 \cdot \left(\pr{\wins} - \frac{1}{2}\right)                                                   \\

	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Reducing to EAV security}

Recall case (\ref{qs-triggered-case-2}) in the high-level discussion of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}: the adversary $\adv$ was able to learn the seed $s_w$ given the EAV secure encryptions $\Pi_s.\enc_{k_1}(s_w), \ldots, \Pi_s.\enc_{k_d}(s_w)$. We can see $\adv$ as an adversary against a security game where $\adv$ is given $d$ EAV secure encryptions $c_1 \from \Pi_s.\enc_{k_1}(m), \ldots, c_d \from \Pi_s.\enc_{k_d}(m)$ of a message $m$ with $k_i \from \Pi_s.\gen(1^\eta)$ and must compute $m$. If we can prove that beating such a game is hard, then we can bound the probability of $\adv$ actually learning $s_w$ in this way.

This is exactly how we proceed in this section. Instead of asking the adversary to compute an encrypted message $m$, we turn to a more familiar decisional formulation as in the IND-CPA game (where the adversary may choose a pair $m_0, m_1$ and must distinguish whether the $d$ ciphertexts encrypt $m_0$ or $m_1$). We call this security notion \emph{EAV security under multiple (M) independent (I) encryptions of a single (S) pair of messages} (MIS-EAV).

\begin{definition}[The MIS-EAV game]
	Let $\kappa$ denote the security parameter and let $\Pi$ a private-key encryption scheme. Define the game $\game{\Pi}{\kappa}{MIS-EAV}(\adv)$ for an adversary $\adv$:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item The adversary $\adv$ outputs $q \in \N$ and a pair of messages $m_0, m_1$ of the same length. We refer to $q$ as the number of \emph{queries} made by $\adv$.
		\item A bit $b \from \{0, 1\}$ is sampled. For each $i \in [q]$, $\adv$ is given an encryption $c_i \from \Pi.\enc_{k_i}(m_b)$ where $k_i \from \Pi.\gen(1^\kappa)$ is generated independently of the other keys.
		\item $\adv$ outputs a bit $b'$. The output of the game is defined to be $1$ if $b' = b$, and $0$ otherwise.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[MIS-EAV security]
	A private-key encryption scheme $\Pi$ is \emph{$(t, \epsilon, q)$-MIS-EAV-secure} if for all $\kappa$, for any adversary $\adv$ making at most $q(\kappa)$ queries and running in time $t(\kappa)$ we have
	\begin{align*}
		\advantage{\Pi}{\kappa}{MIS-EAV}(\adv) \coloneqq 2 \cdot \left(\pr{\game{\Pi}{\kappa}{MIS-EAV}(\adv) = 1} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \le \epsilon(\kappa).
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Similar to how IND-CPA security for a single encryption query implies IND-CPA security for $q$ queries with a security loss of $q$ by a standard hybrid argument, one can show that EAV security implies MIS-EAV security with the same loss. To see why, recall the hybrid argument for IND-CPA security (as discussed in e.g. \cite[Theorem 12.6]{introduction-to-modern-cryptography}): We define the sequence of hybrid games $H_0, \ldots, H_q$ where in the game $H_i$ the first $i$ encryption queries encrypt the second message and the remaining $q - i$ queries encrypt the first message. Then given an IND-CPA adversary $\adv$ for multiple encryptions, an IND-CPA adversary $\adv'$ is constructed to bound
\[
	\abs*{\pr{\adv \text{ outputs } 0 \text{ in game } H_{i - 1}} - \pr{\adv \text{ outputs } 0 \text{ in game } H_{i}}}
\]
for arbitrary $i$.
The adversary $\adv'$ simulates $H_{i - 1}$ or $H_{i}$ to $\adv$ depending on whether the ciphertext received from the (single-query) IND-CPA challenger, which gets passed on as the response to the $i$-th query, encrypts the first or the second message from the $i$-th pair of messages. $\adv'$ then uses the encryption oracle to pass on the right encryptions to $\adv$ for all other queries. Now notice that if we wanted to simulate to an MIS-EAV adversary we wouldn't need access to an encryption oracle since for the MIS-EAV security game all the other encryptions can easily be generated by $\adv'$ sampling the new keys itself.

The argument would of course also work without restricting the adversary to a single pair of messages (which we could call MI-EAV security). However, we will make use of this restriction to provide a tighter reduction for a certain class of schemes at the end of this section.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav}
	Let $\Pi$ a private-key encryption scheme with finite message space. Let $t_{\gen}, t_{\enc}$ functions in $\kappa$ that upper bound the runtime of $\Pi.\gen$ and $\Pi.\enc$, respectively. If $\Pi$ is $(t, \epsilon)$-EAV-secure, then for any function $q$, $\Pi$ is $(\tilde{t}, q \cdot \epsilon, q)$-MIS-EAV-secure with $\tilde{t} = t - \mathcal{O}(q \cdot (t_\gen + t_\enc))$.
\end{lemma}

The details of the proof can be found in Section~\ref{sec:mis-eav-from-eav-proof} of the appendix.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:eav-reduction}
	Recall the assumptions, variables and events from the statement and proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}. In particular, assume that $\Pi_s$ is $(t, \eeav)$-EAV-secure. Let $\eta$ arbitrary and let $\adv$ an SD-GSD adversary constructing a GSD graph of size at most $N(\eta)$ and indegree at most $\delta(\eta)$, making at most $\ms(\eta)$ queries to $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ and at most $\mdh(\eta)$ queries to $\hdh$, and running in time $\tilde{t}(\eta)$. Then
	\[
		\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,} \le \delta \cdot N \cdot \eeav + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^\rho}.
	\]
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Intuition} By Lemma~\vref{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav} we know that $\Pi_s$ is MIS-EAV secure. Continuing the high-level argument before the proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}, consider the first moment that $\adv$ triggers $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ by querying the seed of some safe node $w$.  As intended, it follows from the definition of the event $\fdh$ that from $\adv$'s perspective all DHIES ciphertexts it got from queries $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, w)$ for any $u$ contain encryptions of $s_w$ under independent, uniformly random keys using $\Pi_s$. Moreover, as already argued once, $\adv$ has learned nothing from a potential seed dependency $(p, w)$, so these encryptions are everything $\adv$ had at its proposal to learn $s_w$.

\todo{Add plot.}

We can use $\adv$'s ability to compute the seed $s_w$ of a safe node $w$ from encryptions of $s_w$ to construct an MIS-EAV adversary: We first guess a node $w$ whose seed $\adv$ may query first. Next we give the MIS-EAV challenger $s_w$ and some other independent seed $s$. We simulate the SD-GSD game to $\adv$ and embed the encryptions from the MIS-EAV challenger when answering queries of the form $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, w)$ for any $u$. Now consider the behavior of $\adv$ depending on which seed the challenger chooses to encrypt:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the challenger chooses to encrypt $s_w$, then $\adv$ will trigger the event $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ with the same probability as before. We can detect whether $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ gets triggered since all seeds in the simulation are known. If $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ occurs and we guessed $w$ correctly, the event will be triggered at $w$ and $\adv$ will query $s_w$, telling us that the challenger encrypted $s_w$.
	\item If the challenger chooses to encrypt $s$, then $\adv$ receives no information about $s_w$ and has negligible probability of querying it.
\end{itemize}
Thus, the advantage of the MIS-EAV adversary is about $\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}/N$, where the factor $1/N$ arises from guessing $w$, and using that $\Pi_s$ is MIS-EAV secure we can bound this probability. Since we are only interested in checking whether the event was triggered for $w$, the adversary can abort when this is no longer possible ($w$ is corrupted, some other hidden seed is queried, etc.).

\begin{proof}[of Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}]
	As motivated above we construct an MIS-EAV adversary $\adv'$ to derive the bound. $\adv'$ behaves as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item $\adv'$ runs $\adv$ to get $n$ and $D$ and initializes the GSD graph, seeds and the set of edges and corrupted nodes as in step \ref{def:sd-gsd-game-step-init} of the SD-GSD game.
		\item \label{eav-reduction-mis-eav-adversary-step-init} $\adv'$ samples $w \from [n], s \from \{0, 1\}^\rho$ and gives $\delta$ and the messages $s_w, s$ to the challenger. Let $c_1, \ldots, c_\delta$ the encryptions it gets back.
		\item $\adv'$ faithfully simulates the SD-GSD game to $\adv$ with the following exception: Whenever $\adv$ makes a query of the form $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, w)$ for any $u$, $\adv'$ replies with $\langle g^x, c_i \rangle$ where $x \from [q]$ and $i$ is the index of the next ciphertext (from step \ref{eav-reduction-mis-eav-adversary-step-init}) not yet used.

		      All random oracles queries are simulated by sampling the output of the oracle u.a.r. for new queries and using the value first sampled for repeated queries.

		      During the simulation $\adv'$ also pays attention to the following:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item If any of the following events occur, $\adv'$ aborts the simulation and outputs 1:
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\hdh$ for a hidden Diffie-Hellman key
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ for a hidden seed that is not $s_w$
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\operatorname{corrupt}(u)$ for some node $u$ such that $w$ is no longer safe
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item If $\adv$ queries $\hgen(s_w)$ or $\hdep(s_w)$, $\adv'$ aborts the simulation and outputs 0. This is the only point at which $\adv'$ outputs 0.
		      \end{itemize}

		      If the simulation arrives to the point where $\adv$ outputs its guess (step \ref{def:sd-gsd-game-step-output} of the SD-GSD game), then $\adv'$ outputs 1.
	\end{enumerate}

	The advantage of $\adv'$ is given by
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage}
		\advantage{\Pi_s}{\eta}{MIS-EAV}(\adv') \stackrel{\eqref{eq:advantage-equality}}{=}  \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} - \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1},
	\end{equation}
	where $b$ is the bit sampled by the MIS-EAV challenger.


	First, we will show that
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=0}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} \ge \frac{\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}}{N}.
	\end{equation}
	Let $E = \qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ and let $E'$ the same event in the SD-GSD game simulated to $\adv$ during an execution of $\game{\Pi_s}{\eta}{MIS-EAV}(\adv')$ with $b = 0$. In the following while showing \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=0} we will implicitly assume that $b = 0$ when referring to the game simulated to $\adv$ by $\adv'$.
	On a high level \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=0} holds due to the fact that as long as the game has not been aborted the encryptions $\adv$ receives from $\adv'$ are indistinguishable from what it would get in the real SD-GSD game and we get a factor $\frac{1}{N}$ from guessing the node that triggered $E$. However, showing this requires a few steps.

	Consider a modification of the SD-GSD game $G_1$ where the game is aborted whenever one of the following events occurs, where for all these events $\adv'$ would also abort the simulation:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\adv$ queries $\hdh$ for a hidden Diffie-Hellman key
		\item $\adv$ queries $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ for a hidden seed
	\end{itemize}
	(Since we are not interested in the output of the game we can define \emph{aborting the game} as the game ending with output 0.) The game $G_1$ is something between the real SD-GSD game and what $\adv'$ simulates to $\adv$. The only difference in when $G_1$ aborts compared to the game simulated by $\adv'$ is that we aren't paying attention to some specific node $w$ remaining safe. Aborting the game in this way does not alter the probability of $\adv$ triggering the event $E$ in $G_1$, since in either case when the game is aborted either $E$ or $\overline{E}$ is already known to hold:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $\adv$ queries $\hdh$ for a hidden Diffie-Hellman key, then it triggers $\qdh$ and $\qs$ has not been triggered before since this would have caused the game to be aborted. Thus, $\adv$ triggered $\fdh$ and $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ cannot hold in this execution of the game.
		\item If $\adv$ queries $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ for a hidden seed, then this triggers $\qs$. Moreover, $\overline{\fdh}$ also holds at this moment since the game would have aborted earlier if $\qdh$ had already been triggered. Thus, $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ holds.
	\end{itemize}
	Let $E_1$ the same event as $E$ in the game $G_1$. As argued above we have
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-E=E_1}
		\pr{E_1} = \pr{E}.
	\end{equation}


	Now consider a game $G_2$ which is a modification of the game $G_1$ where at the beginning of the game $w_2 \from [n]$ is sampled and the game also aborts if $\adv$ queries $\operatorname{corrupt}(u)$ for some node $u$ such that $w_2$ is no longer safe, just as in the game simulated by $\adv'$. The game $G_2$ is again something between the game $G_1$ and what $\adv'$ simulates to $\adv$. We also modify $G_1$ such that it also samples $w_1 \from [n]$ at the beginning of the game. This does not change the fact that \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-E=E_1} holds as the sampling of $w_1$ has no effect on the execution of the game.

	Let $E_2$ and $E'$ the events corresponding to $E$ in the game $G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$, respectively. We further introduce a new random variable $W$ to analyze each game where
	\[
		W = \begin{cases}
			0 & \overline{E}                       \\
			x & E \text{ was triggered at node } x
		\end{cases}
	\]
	(if $x$ is not unique we choose the node with lowest identifier).
	Let $W_1$, $W_2$ and $W'$ be the corresponding random variables in game $G_1$, game $G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$. Consider the probability $\pr{W_1 = w_1 \mid E_1}$. The node $w_1$ is sampled independently and does not affect the execution of the game. Therefore, in an execution where $E_1$ occurs and the GSD graph has size $n$ (so $W_1 \in [n]$), we correctly guess $W_1 = w_1$ with probability exactly $\frac{1}{n} \ge \frac{1}{N}$. Thus
	\[
		\pr{W_1 = w_1 \mid E_1} \ge \frac{1}{N}
	\]
	and combining this with \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-E=E_1} we get
	\begin{align} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-detect-E1-G1}
		\begin{split}
			\pr{W_1 = w_1} & = \pr{W_1 = w_1 \land E_1} \\
			& = \pr{W_1 = w_1 \mid E_1} \cdot \pr{E_1} \\
			& \ge \frac{1}{N} \cdot \pr{E}.
		\end{split}
	\end{align}

	Analogously to the argument used to justify \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-E=E_1}, we can argue that
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G1-vs-G2}
		\pr{W_1 = w_1} = \pr{W_2 = w_2}.
	\end{equation}
	The only difference from $G_1$ to $G_2$ is that $G_2$ aborts when $w_2$ is no longer safe. But if $w_2$ is no longer safe then we know that $W_2 \neq w_2$ (if $W_2 = w_2$ the game would have already aborted when $w_2$'s seed was queried while it was safe). Thus, \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G1-vs-G2} indeed holds.

	We now show an analogous result comparing the game $G_2$ to the game simulated by $\adv'$:
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G2-vs-simulation}
		\pr{W_2 = w_2} = \pr{W' = w}.
	\end{equation}
	Consider how $G_2$ differs from the game simulated by $\adv'$. Both games abort at exactly the same events (this is easy to see). They only differ in how $\adv'$ answers queries $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, w)$ for any $u$. In $G_2$ such a query is answered with a ciphertext $\langle g^x, c \rangle$ where $x \from [q], c \from \Pi_s.\enc_k(s_w)$ and $k = \hdh(pk_u^x)$. $\adv'$ answers such a query with $\langle g^{x'}, c' \rangle$ where $x' \from [q], c' \from \Pi_s.\enc_{k'}(s_w)$ and $k' \from \{0, 1\}^\eta$. Now notice that as long as the game $G_2$ is ongoing, $pk_u^{x}$ is a hidden Diffie-Hellman key and $\adv$ has not queried $pk_u^{x}$ to $\hdh$. If it had, then the game would have already aborted. Therefore, from $\adv$'s view $k$ follows the same distribution as $k'$. Thus, overall the game $G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$ are indistinguishable to $\adv$ and \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G2-vs-simulation} holds.

	Finally, notice that if the event $W' = w$ occurred, then $\adv'$ outputs $0$. Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} & \ge \pr{W' = w}                                                              \\
		                              & \stackrel{\eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G2-vs-simulation}}{=} \pr{W_2 = w_2} \\
		                              & \stackrel{\eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-G1-vs-G2}}{=}  \pr{W_1 = w_1}        \\
		                              & \stackrel{\eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-detect-E1-G1}}{\ge} \frac{\pr{E}}{N} \\
		                              & = \frac{\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}}{N},
	\end{align*}
	as promised.

	Second, returning to \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage}, we can more easily show that $\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1}$ is negligible. In the SD-GSD game simulated to $\adv$ during an execution of $\game{\Pi_s}{\eta}{MIS-EAV}(\adv')$ with $b = 1$, the seed $s_w$ is a random variable independent of any information given to $\adv$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the game aborts when $w$ becomes unsafe, so $s_w$ cannot be learned by querying $\operatorname{corrupt}(w)$ or by querying $\hdep(s_p)$ for an unsafe node $p$ where $(p, w)$ is a seed dependency
		\item querying $\hdep(s_p)$ for a safe node $p$ where $(p, w)$ is a seed dependency results in the game being aborted and by virtue of $\hdep$ being a random oracle, from $\adv$'s perspective $s_w$ follows the same distribution regardless of whether there is a seed dependency $(p, w)$ or not
		\item with $b = 1$ queries $\operatorname{encrypt}(u, w)$ yield encryptions of $s$ instead of $s_w$
	\end{itemize}
	Therefore, for any seed $s'$ that $\adv$ queries to $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ we have
	\[
		\pr{s_w = s'} = \frac{1}{2^\rho}.
	\]
	Thus, by a union bound we have
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=1}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1} \le \frac{\ms}{2^\rho}.
	\end{equation}

	Combining \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage}, \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=0} and \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-b=1} we get
	\begin{align} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage-lower-bound}
		\begin{split}
			\advantage{\Pi_s}{\eta}{MIS-EAV}(\adv') & = \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} - \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1}           \\
			& \ge \frac{\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}}{N} - \frac{\ms}{2^\rho}.
		\end{split}
	\end{align}
	Furthermore, going through the details yields that $\adv'$ runs in time
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{split}
			t_{\adv'} \coloneqq \tilde{t} + \mathcal{O}\big(\rho \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} \cdot \ms & + (\gamma + \eta \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}}) \cdot \mdh  \\
			& + N \cdot (\rho \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} + t_{\dhies.\gen})  \\
			& +  N^2 \cdot t_{\dhies.\enc}\big)
		\end{split}
	\end{align*}
	(note that $t_{\adv'}$ is a constant).
	Using that $\delta \le N, t_{\Pi_s.\gen} \le \mathcal{O}(\eta \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}})$, $t_{\Pi_s.\enc} \le t_{\dhies.\enc}$ (as encrypting with $\dhies$ involves an encryption with $\Pi_s$), the definition of $\tilde{t}$, with appropriately chosen constants we have
	\[
		t_{\adv'} & \le t - \mathcal{O}(\delta \cdot (t_{\Pi_s.\gen} + t_{\Pi_s.\enc})).
	\]
	By Lemma~\ref{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav} $\Pi_s$ is $(t - \mathcal{O}(\delta \cdot (t_{\Pi_s.\gen} + t_{\Pi_s.\enc})), \delta \cdot \eeav, \delta)$-MIS-EAV-secure, so
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage-upper-bound}
		\advantage{\Pi_s}{\eta}{MIS-EAV}(\adv') = \delta \cdot \eeav.
	\end{equation}

	Finally, if we now combine \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage-lower-bound} and \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-advantage-upper-bound} we get
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}}{N} - \frac{\ms}{2^\rho} & \le \delta \cdot \eeav                                       \\
		                                                                & \iff                                                         \\
		\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,}                                & \le \delta \cdot N \cdot \eeav + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^\rho},
	\end{align*}
	as was to prove.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Tighter MIS-EAV security for certain schemes} \label{sec:tighter-mis-eav-security}

In our reduction from MIS-EAV security to EAV security (Lemma~\ref{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav}) we applied a general hybrid argument. It is also tempting to try a more direct approach. The EAV and MIS-EAV games seem less far apart than IND-CPA for single and multiple encryptions: All additional encryptions in the MIS-EAV game encrypt the same message, with the only difference being that each encryption is performed using a fresh key. If only we could take a single encryption $c \from \enc_k(m)$ and from it produce several encryptions $c_i \from \enc_{k_i}(m)$ for $k_i \from \gen(1^\kappa)$ (without knowing $k$ or $m$), then the additional encryptions would leak no new information to the adversary, and we would have a tight bound on MIS-EAV security from EAV security. There is a simple EAV secure scheme that achieves the above property: the one-time pad. Given an encryption $c = k \oplus m$, we can just sample $k' \from \{0, 1\}^\kappa$ and compute the ciphertext $c' = c \oplus k' = (k \oplus k') \oplus m$, an encryption of $m$ under the uniformly random key $k \oplus k'$. In the following, we formalize this property of a private-key encryption scheme and use it to prove the desired bound on MIS-EAV security.

\begin{definition}[Key-rerandomizability] \label{def:key-rerandomizability}
	Let $\kappa$ denote the security parameter and let $\Pi = (\gen, \enc, \dec)$ a private-key encryption scheme. $\Pi$ is \emph{key-rerandomizable} if there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm $\operatorname{ReRan}$ achieving the following: Let $\kappa, k \from \gen(1^\kappa)$, $m$ in the message space and $c \from \enc_k(m)$ arbitrary but fixed\footnote{Here we are quantifying over all possible keys $k$ and ciphertexts $c$ that can be output by $\gen(1^\kappa)$ and $\enc_k(m)$.}. Then the distribution over ciphertexts as defined by computing $c' \from \operatorname{ReRan}(1^\kappa, c)$ is identical to the distribution over ciphertexts resulting from the process of first sampling $k' \from \gen(1^\kappa)$ and then computing a ciphertext $c' \from \enc_{k'}(m)$.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Example} As outlined above, the one-time pad is an example of a key-rerandomizable encryption scheme.

\question{Is there a key-rerandomizable IND-CPA secure scheme? If yes, this would imply a key-rerandomizable AE scheme using the encrypt-then-authenticate paradigm, since a rerandomized tag can easily produced for the ciphertext by sampling a fresh MAC key.}

The key idea underlying the proof of the following Lemma was already provided at the beginning of this section.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav-with-key-rerandomizability}
	Let $\Pi$ a key-rerandomizable private-key encryption scheme with finite message space. Let $\operatorname{ReRan}$ the corresponding algorithm to rerandomize ciphertexts and $t_{\operatorname{ReRan}}$ an upper bound for the runtime of $\operatorname{ReRan}$. If $\Pi$ is $(t, \epsilon)$-EAV-secure, then for all $q \in \N$, $\Pi$ is $(\tilde{t}, \epsilon, q)$-MIS-EAV-secure with $\tilde{t} = t - \mathcal{O}(q \cdot t_{\operatorname{ReRan}})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Note that since the message space and thus the ciphertext space is finite, the runtime of $\operatorname{ReRan}$ is indeed bounded. Let $\kappa$ arbitrary. Let $\adv$ an MIS-EAV adversary running in time $\tilde{t}(\kappa)$ and making at most $q(\kappa)$ queries. We construct an EAV adversary $\adv'$ that behaves as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item $\adv'$ runs $\adv$ to get the number of queries $q$ and messages $m_0, m_1$.
		\item $\adv'$ gives $m_0, m_1$ to the challenger and receives the ciphertext $c_1$.
		\item $\adv'$ computes ciphertexts $c_2 \from \operatorname{ReRan}(1^\kappa, c_1), \ldots, c_q \from \operatorname{ReRan}(1^\kappa, c_1)$ (with independent runs of $\operatorname{ReRan}$).
		\item $\adv'$ gives the ciphertexts $c_1, \ldots, c_q$ to $\adv$.
		\item $\adv'$ outputs whatever bit $\adv$ outputs.
	\end{enumerate}
	We apply the properties of $\operatorname{ReRan}$ given in Definition~\ref{def:key-rerandomizability} to show that the game simulated to $\adv$ is distributed identically to the MIS-EAV game. For this we need only show that the ciphertexts $c_1, \ldots, c_q$ given to $\adv$ in the simulation are distributed identically to the ciphertexts $c_1', \ldots, c_q'$ that $\adv$ would get in the real MIS-EAV game. It is immediate that $c_1$ is distributed identically to $c_1'$. Now let $i \in \{2, \ldots, q\}$. By Definition~\ref{def:key-rerandomizability} $\operatorname{ReRan}(c)$ outputs a ciphertext encrypting $m_b$ (where $b$ is the bit chosen by the EAV challenger) distributed identically to a ciphertext encrypting $m_b$ output by the MIS-EAV challenger. Thus, indeed for any $i$, $c_i$ is distributed identically to $c_i'$ and the claim holds. Therefore
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-key-rerandomizability-advantage-same}
		\advantage{\Pi}{\kappa}{MIS-EAV}(\adv) = \advantage{\Pi}{\kappa}{EAV}(\adv').
	\end{equation}

	Because $\adv'$ is an EAV adversary running in time $\tilde{t} + \mathcal{O}(q \cdot t_{\operatorname{ReRan}}) = t$ we know that
	\[
		\advantage{\Pi}{\kappa}{EAV}(\adv') \le \epsilon(\kappa),
	\]
	which together with \eqref{eq:lemma-key-rerandomizability-advantage-same} concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

By assuming a key-rerandomizable encryption scheme and applying Lemma~\vref{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav-with-key-rerandomizability} instead of the hybrid argument (Lemma~\ref{lemma:mis-eav-from-eav}) in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}, we can drop the $\delta$ factor in the bound. This also allows us to drop the $\delta$ factor in Theorem~\vref{theorem:sdgsd-security}.

\begin{corollary}
	Recall the setting of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}. If the private-key encryption scheme $\Pi_s$ is additionally key-rerandomizable, then the bound in Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction} can be improved to
	\[
		\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh}\,} \le N \cdot \eeav + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^\rho}
	\]
	and the bound $\tilde{\epsilon}$ on the success probability of an SD-GSD adversary thus improved to
	\[
		\tilde{\epsilon} = 2 \cdot N \cdot (\eeav + \eddh) + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^{\eta - 1}} + \frac{\ms \cdot N}{2^{\rho - 1}}
	\]
	(with appropriate changes to the runtime $\tilde{t}$).
\end{corollary}


\subsection{Reducing to the DDH problem}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:dh-reduction}
	Recall the assumptions, variables and events from the statement and proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:sdgsd-security}. In particular, assume that the DDH problem is $(t, \eddh)$-hard relative to $\mathcal{G}$. Let $\eta$ arbitrary and let $\adv$ an SD-GSD adversary constructing a GSD graph of size at most $N(\eta)$ and indegree at most $\delta(\eta)$, making at most $\ms(\eta)$ queries to $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ and at most $\mdh(\eta)$ queries to $\hdh$, and running in time $\tilde{t}(\eta)$. Then
	\[
		\pr{\qs \land \fdh} \le N \cdot \eddh + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^{\eta - 1}}.
	\]
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Intuition} We will bound the simpler event $\fdh$. This event tells us that there is some safe node $a$ in the GSD graph with encryption edges to nodes $u_1, \ldots, u_d$, where the query $\operatorname{encrypt}(a, u_i)$ returned the ciphertext $\langle g^{y_i}, \Pi_s.\enc_{k_i}(s_{u_i}) \rangle$ with $k_i = \hdh(g^{sk_{a} \cdot y_i})$, such that $g^{sk_a \cdot y_j}$ was the first hidden Diffie-Hellman key queried by $\adv$ for some $j$.
Moreover, at the time $g^{sk_a \cdot y_j}$ was queried, no hidden seed had yet been queried by $\adv$, implying that $\adv$ had not queried $\hgen(s_a)$ and thus had no information about $sk_a$ besides $pk_a$ (recall that $(pk_a, sk_a) = \dhies.\gen(1^\eta, \hgen(s_a))$).

\todo{Add plot.}

It is interesting to note that our approach does not require that $\adv$ has not queried $\hdep$ for a hidden seed (i.e. that $\qdep$ was not triggered) as is implied by the event $\fdh$, because knowing $\hgen(s_a)$ is the only way to learn about $sk_a$. Regardless, we still want to have our definition of $\fdh$ include this information, as the bound on $\pr{\qs \land \overline{\fdh} \,}$ in Lemma~\vref{lemma:eav-reduction} relies on the fact that in the event of $\qs \land \overline{\fdh}$ happening,  $\qdh$ was not yet triggered when the event $\qs$ was triggered, i.e. when either the event $\qgen$ \emph{or} the event $\qdep$ was triggered.

The intuition is clear that this means that $\adv$ solved the Diffie-Hellman challenge $(g^{sk_a}, g^{y_j})$. What is not immediately clear is how to embed a \emph{given} Diffie-Hellman challenge $(g^x, g^y)$  from an instance of the DDH game and use $\adv$ to tell whether the key $k$ chosen by the challenger is the real key $g^{x \cdot y}$ or a uniformly random group element.
An intuitive strategy would be to embed the challenge by setting $pk_a = g^x$ and $g^{y_j} = g^y$, which involves guessing $u_j$, and simply checking whether for any of the queries $q_i$ to $\hdh$ by $\adv$, such that $q_i$ encodes a group element in $\mathbb{G}$, it holds that $q_i = k$. Now:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $k = g^{x \cdot y}$, $\adv$ triggers $\fdh$ and we guessed $a$ and $u_j$ correctly, then indeed as described above $q_i = g^{sk_a \cdot y_j} = g^{x \cdot y} = k$ will hold for some $i$.
	\item If $k$ is a random group element, then $\adv$ has negligible probability of querying $k$, as no information about $k$ is ever leaked to $\adv$.
\end{itemize}
If we make sure not to change $\adv$'s view of the game in the case $k = g^{x \cdot y}$ in this process, we can achieve an advantage of about $\pr{\fdh} / N^2$, where one factor $1/N$ arises from guessing $a$ and another from guessing $u_j$. Unfortunately, this would yield no improvement over the result from \cite{ttkem}.

To avoid this issue, we can use random self-reducability of the DDH problem. We can avoid guessing $u_j$ by being more clever about how we embed $g^y$. Instead of embedding $g^y$ into a single encryption edge, we embed it into all $d$ encryption edges. To get a uniformly random exponent from $y$ we set $y_j = y + r_j \mod q$ with $r_j \from [q]$. Given $g^{x \cdot y_j}$, we can easily compute $g^{x \cdot y}$:
\[
	g^{x \cdot y_j} = g^{x \cdot (y + r_j)} = g^{x \cdot y}	\cdot g^{x \cdot r_j} \iff g^{x \cdot y} = g^{x \cdot y_j} \cdot \underbrace{((g^x)^{r_j})^{-1}}_{\eqqcolon \, R_j}.
\]
Now to determine whether $k$ is the real Diffie-Hellman key, we check whether $q_i \cdot R_j = k$ for some $i, j$. This yields an advantage of about $\pr{\fdh} / N$ (and a slightly larger runtime). We can now proceed with the full proof.

\begin{proof}[of Lemma~\ref{lemma:dh-reduction}]
	As outlined above we use $\adv$ to construct a DDH adversary $\adv'$.
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item $\adv'$ gets $h_1, h_2$ and $k$ from the DDH challenger.
		\item $\adv'$ runs $\adv$ to get $n$ and $D$, samples $a \from [n]$ and initializes the GSD graph, seeds and the set of edges and corrupted nodes as in step \ref{def:sd-gsd-game-step-init} of the SD-GSD game, with the sole exception that $pk_a = h_1$ (as opposed to setting it to the public key output by $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta, \hgen(s_a))$).
		\item $\adv'$ faithfully simulates the SD-GSD game to $\adv$ with the following exception: For the $j$-th query $\operatorname{encrypt}(a, u_j)$ made by $\adv$, $\adv'$ replies with $\langle h_2 \cdot g^{r_j}, \Pi_s.\enc_{k_j}(s_{u_j}) \rangle$ where $r_j \from [q]$, $k_j \from \{0, 1\}^\kappa$. $\adv'$ also computes and stores $R_j = \left(pk_a^{r_j}\right)^{-1}$.

		      All random oracles queries are simulated by sampling the output of the oracle u.a.r. for new queries and using the value first sampled for repeated queries.

		      During the simulation $\adv'$ also pays attention to the following:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item If any of the following events occur, $\adv'$ aborts the simulation and outputs 1:
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\hdh$ for a hidden Diffie-Hellman key on an encryption edge $(u, v) \in E$ with $u \neq a$
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ for a hidden seed
				            \item $\adv$ queries $\operatorname{corrupt}(u)$ for some node $u$ such that $a$ is no longer safe
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item If $\adv$ queries $q_i$ to $\hdh$ such that $q_i \cdot R_j = k$ for some $j$, $\adv'$ aborts the simulation and outputs 0. This is the only point at which $\adv'$ outputs 0.
		      \end{itemize}

		      If the simulation arrives to the point where $\adv$ outputs its guess (step \ref{def:sd-gsd-game-step-output} of the SD-GSD game), then $\adv'$ outputs 1.
	\end{enumerate}

	The advantage of $\adv'$ is given by
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-advantage}
		\advantage{\mathcal{G}}{\eta}{DDH}(\adv') \stackrel{\eqref{eq:advantage-equality}}{=} \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} - \pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1},
	\end{equation}
	where $b$ is the bit sampled by the DDH challenger.

	First, we will show that
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-b=0}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} \ge \frac{\pr{\fdh}}{N}.
	\end{equation}
	This part of the proof proceeds very similarly to the proof of Lemma~\vref{lemma:eav-reduction} and we will be a bit more concise. We focus on executions of $\game{\mathcal{G}}{\eta}{DDH}(\adv)$ with $b = 0$. Let the games $G_1, G_2$ be defined as in Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}, where we denote the node sampled at the beginning of each game by $a_1, a_2$, respectively (as opposed to $w_1, w_2$). Let $E = \fdh$ and let $E_1, E_2$ and $E'$ be the analogous events in $G_1, G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$ (note that in this latter game, the group elements $pk_a^{\log_g(h_2) + r_j}$ are also hidden Diffie-Hellman keys). Finally, we introduce the random variable
	\[
		A = \begin{cases}
			0 & \overline{\fdh}                                                                    \\
			x & \text{$\fdh$ holds and $\qdh$ was triggered on an encryption edge with source $x$}
		\end{cases}
	\]
	(if $x$ is not unique we choose the node with smallest identifier) and let $A_1, A_2$ and $A'$ denote the corresponding random variables in game $G_1$, game $G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$.

	Just as argued in Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction},
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-E=E_1}
		\pr{E_1} = \pr{E}
	\end{equation}
	holds, since whenever $G_1$ aborts, it is already decided whether $\fdh$ holds:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the game was aborted when $\adv$ queried a hidden Diffie-Hellman key, then $\fdh$ holds.
		\item If the game was aborted when $\adv$ queried $\hgen$ or $\hdep$ for a hidden seed, $\fdh$ does not hold.
	\end{itemize}

	Next, the inequality
	\[
		\pr{A_1 = a_1 \mid E_1} \ge \frac{1}{N}
	\]
	and therefore also
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-detect-E1-G1}
		\pr{A_1 = a_1} \ge \frac{1}{N} \cdot \pr{E}
	\end{equation}
	hold for the same reason that
	\[
		\pr{W_1 = w_1 \mid E_1} \ge \frac{1}{N}
	\]
	and \eqref{eq:lemma-eav-reduction-detect-E1-G1} held in Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}.

	Then, the equality
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-G1-vs-G2}
		\pr{A_1 = a_1} = \pr{A_2 = a_2}
	\end{equation}
	holds again due to the fact that when $G_2$ aborts because $a_2$ is no longer safe, we know that $A_2 \neq a_2$.

	Finally, we need to argue that
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-G2-vs-simulation}
		\pr{A_2 = a_2} = \pr{A' = a}.
	\end{equation}
	Consider how $G_2$ differs from the game simulated by $\adv'$. As in Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction}, both games abort at exactly the same events (note that if $q_i \cdot R_j = k$ holds and $\adv$ outputs $1$, then $q_i = k \cdot R_j^{-1} = k \cdot pk_a^{r_j} = h_1^{\log_g(h_2)} \cdot pk_a^{r_j} = pk_a^{\log_g(h_2) + r_j}$, a hidden Diffie-Hellman key). The game simulated by $\adv'$ differs in two aspects:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item $\adv'$ sets $pk_a$ to $h_1$ and not to the public key output by $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta, \hgen(s_a))$
		\item $\adv'$ answers queries $\operatorname{encrypt}(a, u)$ differently
	\end{enumerate}
	Note that as long as the game $G_2$ is ongoing, $\adv$ has not queried $\hgen$ for $s_a$ or $\hdh$ for a hidden Diffie-Hellman key. Both differences are therefore indistinguishable:
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item By Definition~\ref{def:public-key-encryption}, the output of $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta, r)$ with $r \from \{0, 1\}^\rho$ follows the same distribution as the output of $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta)$. The former process is behind the distribution of $pk_a$ as viewed from $\adv$ in $G_2$, as $\adv$ has not queried $\hgen(s_a)$, and the latter process is behind the distribution of $pk_a$ in the game simulated by $\adv'$, as the DDH challenger generates a public key with the same distribution as $\dhies.\gen(1^\eta)$. Since both processes follow the same distribution, $pk_a$ follows the same in $G_2$ and the game simulated by $\adv'$ from $\adv$'s perspecive.
		\item In $G_2$ a query $\operatorname{encrypt}(a, u)$ is answered with $\langle g^z, c \rangle$ where $z \from [q], c \from \Pi_s.\enc_k(s_u)$ and $k = \hdh(pk_a^z)$. $\adv'$ answers such a query with $\langle g^{\log_g(h_1) + r}, c' \rangle$ where $r \from [q], c' \from \Pi_s.\enc_{k'}(s_u)$ and $k' \from \{0, 1\}^\kappa$. First, $\log_g(h_1) + r$ follows the same distribution as $z$. Second, $pk_a^z$ is a hidden Diffie-Hellman key and from $\adv$'s view $k$ follows the same distribution as $k'$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Thus \eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-G2-vs-simulation} indeed holds.

	Now, again analogous to Lemma~\ref{lemma:eav-reduction} if the event $A' = a$ occurred, then $\adv'$ outputs $0$ and
	\begin{align*}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 0} & \ge \pr{A' = a}                                                                             \\
		                              & \stackrel{\mathclap{\eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-G2-vs-simulation}}}{=} \;\; \pr{A_2 = a_2} \\
		                              & \stackrel{\mathclap{\eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-G1-vs-G2}}}{=} \;\; \pr{A_1 = a_1}         \\
		                              & \stackrel{\mathclap{\eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-detect-E1-G1}}}{\ge} \;\; \frac{\pr{E}}{N} \\
		                              & = \frac{\pr{\fdh}}{N}.
	\end{align*}

	Second, we will show that $\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1}$ is negligible. When $b = 1$ in $\game{\mathcal{G}}{\eta}{DDH}(\adv')$, $k$ is a uniformly random group element independent of any information given to $\adv$, in particular of $q_i \cdot R_j$ for any $i, j$. Thus for any $i, j$,
	\[
		\pr{q_i \cdot R_j = k} = \frac{1}{q} \le \frac{1}{2^\eta},
	\]
	where we used that $q \ge 2^\eta$ by Definition~\ref{def:group-generation-algorithm}.
	Thus, by a union bound and using that $i \in [\mdh], 1 \le j \le N - 1 \le N$ ($j$ is bounded by the maximum outdegree) and  we have
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-b=1}
		\pr{0 \from \adv' \mid b = 1} \le \frac{\mdh \cdot N}{2^\eta}.
	\end{equation}

	Combining \eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-advantage}, \eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-b=0} and \eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-b=1} we get
	\begin{align} \label{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-advantage-lower-bound}
		\begin{split}
			\advantage{\mathcal{G}}{\eta}{DDH}(\adv') \ge \frac{\pr{\fdh}}{N} - \frac{\mdh \cdot N}{2^\eta}.
		\end{split}
	\end{align}

	Furthemore, going through the details yields that $\adv'$ runs in time
	\begin{align*}
		\begin{split}
			t_{\adv'} \coloneqq \tilde{t} + \mathcal{O}\big(\rho \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} \cdot \ms & + (\gamma + \kappa \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}}) \cdot \mdh \\
			& + N \cdot ((\rho + \kappa) \cdot t_{\mathrm{sample}} + \mdh \cdot t_{\mathrm{op}} + t_{\dhies.\gen})  \\
			& +  N^2 \cdot t_{\dhies.\enc}\big).
		\end{split}
	\end{align*}
	Then using the definition of $\tilde{t}$, with appropriately chosen constants we have $t_{\adv'} \le t$. So by virtue of the DDH problem being $(t, \eddh)$-hard relative to $\mathcal{G}$
	\[
		\advantage{\mathcal{G}}{\eta}{DDH}(\adv') \le \eddh
	\]
	and if we combine this with \eqref{eq:lemma-dh-reduction-advantage-lower-bound} we get
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\pr{\fdh}}{N} - \frac{\mdh \cdot N}{2^\eta} & \le \eddh                                          \\
		                                                  & \iff                                               \\
		\pr{\fdh}                                         & \le N \cdot \eddh + \frac{\mdh \cdot N^2}{2^\eta},
	\end{align*}
	concluding the proof.
\end{proof}
